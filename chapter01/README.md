# React Principles

*  React emphasizes functional programming over object-oriented programming.
*  React doesn't require Node.js, but npm for dependencies.
*  You can use Yarn for dependencies instead of npm
```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn add [package-name]
yarn remove [package-name
yarn install        # Install all dependencies]
```

# Tools
